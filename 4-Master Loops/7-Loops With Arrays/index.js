// This will be done only by for loop because that is what we use most of the time.

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

for (let i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}

// First i will be 0
// It will check the condition if 0 < arr.length which is 6
// It will console.log the index of array which is i that is 0 right now
// Then it will increase the i by one
// The whole process repeats until the condition is not correct
