// Synchronous => Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

// Asynchronous => Due to synchronous programming, sometimes important instrcutions get blocked due to the preveious instructions which causes delay in the UI. Asynchronous code allows to execute instructions immediately and doesnt block the flow.
