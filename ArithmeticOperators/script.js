// Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

// Operator	    Description

// +	        Addition
// -	        Subtraction
// *	        Multiplication
// **	        Exponentiation (ES2016)
// /	        Division
// %	        Modulus (Remainder)
// ++	        Increment
// --	        Decrement

// Operator Precedence

// Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

// Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

// When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first

// Example:-

let x = (100 + 50) * 3;

// In this case () will get the precedence then *

// When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right
