// There are two phases happening in Js behind the scenes.

// 1) Memory Creation Phase
// 2) Code Execution Phase

let firstName = "Harpreet";
console.log(firstName);

// Javascript runs this code line by line . In memory creation phase it looks for all variables and stores them as undefined . Then after that code execution phase takes place. So first firstName variable is declared as undefined and then it is given the value of 'Harpreet'.
