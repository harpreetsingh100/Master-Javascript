// An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value. You can create an array in two ways:-

const cars = ["Lexus", "Volvo", "BMW"];
const gaddis = new Array("Toyota", "Honda", "BMW");

// Arrays index starts from zero just like strings. And array has length property too.
// You access an array element by referring to the index number

let car = cars[0];

// This will store Lexus in it.

// Changing an Array Element

cars[0] = "Porsche";
