// Objects are collection of properties.They are in form of key and value pair.It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword. You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:-

const car = {
  type: "Fiat",
  model: "500",
  color: "white",
};

// The key and value pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties: Javascript automatically converts object keys to strings. Even the numbers and data types as a key would convert to string.
